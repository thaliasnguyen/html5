          Yoshiaki Nishimura founded Studio Ponoc on April 15, 2015, and gained the support of several animators previously working under Studio Ghibli, including director Hiromasa Yonebayashi. The name of the studio comes from the Croatian word ponoÄ‡, for "midnight", meant to signify "the beginning of a new day".
